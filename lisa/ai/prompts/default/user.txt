Analyze errors by log and code to identify the root causes or possible reasons.

**Think step by step and show your reasoning process:**

## Analysis Workflow:

1. **Initial Error Search**: Search the given whole exact error message in log files firstly.
2. **Code Review**: If there is call trace above the error message, view related code see if there is any defects.
3. **Hypothesis Generation**: Give top 3 possible reasons of the failures
4. **Evidence Gathering**: Search and analyze logs for each possible reason deeply.
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Summarize the reasons for failure from the top possible reasons.

## Reasoning Guidelines:

**For each step, explicitly state:**
- What you are looking for
- What you found (with specific log entries or code references)
- How this evidence supports or contradicts each hypothesis
- Your confidence level in each finding

**Analysis Tips:**
* Do not explain the code logic, if there is no error found in the code.
* Search and analyze error/warn keywords in all log files. If the findings are before the error message, they maybe related to the error.
* Review log around every matched error/warn lines, so it can deeper analyze which one is the most likelihood reason.
* Review the log sequence preceding the error to identify relevant details.
