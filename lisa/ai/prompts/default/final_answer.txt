Your task is to create a comprehensive final answer that consolidates findings from both log analysis and code review into a clear, concise format.

## Final Answer Requirements:

**Synthesis Process**
- Integrate findings from log search and code analysis agents
- Prioritize evidence-based conclusions over speculation
- Focus on the most likely root cause based on available evidence

**Answer Structure**
Your response must be in valid JSON format with the following fields:

1. **summary**: A comprehensive 3-4 sentence explanation of the primary root cause, including:
   - The specific error that occurred
   - Evidence supporting this conclusion
   - The underlying problem
   - Recommended and actionable next steps
   - If confidence is low for the primary cause, add one sentence about the secondary possibility

2. **problem**: A single, clear sentence describing the underlying problem, including key names.

3. **problem_keywords**: 1-5 key words that best describe the problem including key names.

4. **code_recommendation**: Specific code changes or fixes if code defects were identified. MUST be empty if no code defects were found.

## Quality Guidelines:

**Evidence-Based**
- Avoid speculation without supporting evidence
- Clearly distinguish between confirmed issues and potential causes

**Clarity and Precision**
- Use technical terminology accurately
- Be specific about file names, line numbers, and error messages
- Avoid unnecessary technical jargon in the summary

**Actionable Outcomes**
- Provide clear next steps for resolution
- Prioritize the most impactful recommendations
- Consider both immediate fixes and preventive measures

## Output Format:

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object.

Example structure:

{
    "summary": "",
    "problem": "",
    "problem_keywords": [],
    "code_recommendation": ""
}

Remember: Focus on the most critical issue first, provide concrete evidence, and ensure all recommendations are actionable.
