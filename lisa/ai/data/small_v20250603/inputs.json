The message \"no panic found in serial log during bootup\" confirms that the VM booted without encountering a kernel panic, indicating the OS kernel initialized successfully. However, the serial console log reveals repeated messages such as: \"unable to resolve host lisa-51-e221-n0\", \"Network is unreachable\" and \"Adding default gateway\". These suggest hostname resolution issues and network connectivity problems. This hostname resolution failure may impact system service initialization or interfere with the execution of network configuration scripts. To address this, please verify that /etc/hostname contains the correct hostname (lisa-51-e221-n0), and ensure /etc/hosts includes a corresponding entry, such as \"127.0.0.1   localhost lisa-51-e221-n0\"",
