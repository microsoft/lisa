        This test case will check that L3 cache is correctly mapped
        to NUMA node.
        Steps:
        1. Check if NUMA is disabled in commandline. If disabled,
        and kernel version is <= 2.6.37, test is skipped as hyper-v
        has no support for NUMA : https://t.ly/x8k3
        2. Get the mappings using command :
        `lscpu --extended=cpu,node,socket,cache`
        3. Each line in the mapping corresponds to one CPU core. The L3
        cache of each core must be mapped to the NUMA node that core
        belongs to instead of the core itself.

        Example :
        Correct mapping:
        CPU NODE SOCKET L1d L1i L2 L3
        8   0    0      8   8   8  0
        9   1    1      9   9   9  1

        Incorrect mapping:
        CPU NODE SOCKET L1d L1i L2 L3
        8   0    0      8   8   8  8
        9   1    1      9   9   9  9

            This test will verify if the CPUs inside a Linux VM are processing VMBus
            interrupts by checking the /proc/interrupts file.

            There are 3 types of Hyper-v interrupts : Hypervisor callback
            interrupts, Hyper-V reenlightenment interrupts, and Hyper-V stimer0
            interrupts, these types not shown up in arm64 arch.

            Hyper-V reenlightenment interrupts are 0 unless the VM is doing migration.

            Hypervisor callback interrupts are vmbus events that are generated on all
            the vmbus channels, which belong to different vmbus devices. A VM with upto
            4 vcpu on Azure/Hyper-V should have a NetVSC NIC, which normally has 4 VMBus
            channel and should be bound to all the vCPUs.

            Hyper-V Synthetic timer interrupts should be received on each CPU if the VM
            is run for a long time. We can simulate this process by running CPU
            intensive workload on each vCPU.

            Steps:
            1. Look for the Hyper-v timer property of each vCPU under /proc/interrupts
            2. For Hyper-V reenlightenment interrupt, verify that the interrupt count
            for all vCPU are zero.
            3. For Hypervisor callback interrupt, verify that at least min(#vCPU, 4)
            vCPU's are processing interrupts.
            4. For Hyper-V Synthetic timer, run a CPU intensive command on each vCPU and
            verify that every vCPU is processing the interrupt.
