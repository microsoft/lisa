# patched symmetric_mp example app

The main.c file in this directory is a patched version of the multi_process/symmetric_mp example application from the DPDK project.

https://git.dpdk.org/dpdk/tree/examples/multi_process/symmetric_mp

This change in this main.c is under review, but not merged. This cached version of the main.c file for this app is a workaround for older versions of DPDK. It should build for most if not all recent versions of the project.
