        This case tests the packet forwarded rate of the XDP TX forwarding on
        the single core Synthetic networking. The pktgen samples in Linux code
        base is used to generate packets.

        The minimum cpu count is 8, it makes sure the performance is won't too
        low.

        Three roles in this test environment, 1) sender is to send packets, 2)
        the forwarder is to forward packets to receiver, 3) and the receiver is
        used to receive packets and drop.

        Finally, it checks how many packets arrives to the forwarder or
        receiver. If it's lower than 90%, the test fails. Note, it counts the
        rx_xdp_tx_xmit (mlx5), rx_xdp_tx (mlx4), or dropped count for synthetic
        nic.
