What is a runbook
-----------------

In simple terms:
   `The **runbook** contains all the configurations of LISA operation. It keeps
   you from lengthy command-line commands and makes it easy to adjust
   configurations.`

See :ref:`write_test/concepts:runbook` for further knowledge.

How-to
------

Configure Azure deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below section is for running cases on Azure platform, it specifies:

-  admin_private_key_file: the private key file to access the Azure VM. (Optional)
-  subscription_id: Azure VM is created under this subscription.
-  azcopy_path: the installation path of the AzCopy tool on the machine where LISA is installed. It speeds up copying VHDs between Azure storage accounts. (Optional)

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
     - type: azure
       admin_private_key_file: $(admin_private_key_file)
       azure:
         subscription_id: $(subscription_id)
         azcopy_path: $(azcopy_path)

Select and set test cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below section is to specify P0 and P1 test cases excluding case with
name ``hello``.

.. code:: yaml

   testcase:
     - criteria:
         priority: [0, 1]
     - criteria:
         name: hello
       select_action: exclude

Below section demonstrates how to configure test cases with retry, repetition,
and timeout settings. The first test case will automatically retry up to 2 times
if it fails, redeploying the environment for each retry attempt. The second test
case demonstrates stress testing by running 3 times unconditionally (regardless
of pass/fail) with a custom timeout of 1 hour.

.. code:: yaml

   testcase:
     - criteria:
         priority: 0
       retry: 2
     - criteria:
         name: verify_reboot_in_platform
       times: 3
       timeout: 3600

Use variable and secrets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below section is to specify the variable in name/value format. We can
use this variable in other field in this format ``$(location)``.

.. code:: yaml

   variable:
     - name: location
       value: westus3

The value of variable passed from command line will override the value
in runbook yaml file.

.. code:: bash

   lisa -r sample.yml -v "location:westus3"

Below section is to specify the path of yaml file which stores the
secret values.

.. code:: yaml

   variable:
     - file: secret.yml

Content of secret.yml.

.. code:: yaml

   subscription_id:
     value: replace_your_subscription_id_here
     is_secret: true
     mask: guid

Use partial runbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below three yaml files will be loaded in this sequence.

.. code:: bash

   loading runbook sample.yml
   |-- loading include tier.yml
   |   |-- loading include t0.yml

The variable values in the included yaml file(s) will be overridden by
the including yaml file(s). The relative path is always relative to
the including yaml file.

Part of sample.yml

.. code:: yaml

   include:
     - path: ./tier.yml

Part of tier.yml.

.. code:: yaml

   include:
     - path: ./t$(tier).yml
   variable:
     - name: tier
       value: 0

Part of t0.yml.

.. code:: yaml

   testcase:
     - criteria:
         priority: 0

Use extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below section is to specify path of extensions, the extensions are
modules for test cases or extended features.

.. code:: yaml

   extension:
     - name: extended_features
       path: ../../extensions
     - ../../lisa/microsoft/testsuites/core

Conditionally enable/disable environments or nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``enabled`` field to conditionally enable or disable entire
environments or individual nodes within an environment. This is particularly
useful when combined with variables for dynamic configuration.

Below example shows how to enable/disable environments based on a variable:

.. code:: yaml

   variable:
     - name: use_prod
       value: true
     - name: use_dev
       value: false

   environment:
     environments:
       - name: production_env
         enabled: $(use_prod)  # Controlled by variable
         nodes:
           - type: local
       - name: dev_env
         enabled: $(use_dev)  # This environment will be skipped
         nodes:
           - type: local

Below example shows how to selectively disable specific nodes within an environment:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     environments:
       - name: multi_node_env
         nodes:
           - name: primary_node
             type: local
             enabled: true  # Always enabled
           - name: secondary_node
             type: local
             enabled: false  # Temporarily disabled
           - name: optional_node
             type: remote
             address: 192.168.1.100
             enabled: $(include_remote_node)  # Variable-controlled

This allows you to:

- Temporarily disable environments or nodes without deleting their configuration
- Use variables to control which environments/nodes are active
- Maintain multiple environment configurations and switch between them dynamically

Use transformers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transformers are executed one by one. The order is decided by their
dependencies. If there is no dependencies, their order in runbook affects the
execution order.

Below transformer shows how to deploy a VM in Azure, and export it to a VHD.
Before the exporting, other transformers can be added, like install kernel.

.. code:: yaml

   transformer:
   - type: azure_deploy
     requirement:
       azure:
         marketplace: redhat rhel 7_9 7.9.2021051701
   - type: azure_vhd
     resource_group_name: $(azure_deploy_resource_group_name)
     rename:
       azure_vhd_url: vhd
   - type: azure_delete
     resource_group_name: $(azure_deploy_resource_group_name)

Below is the transformer to build kernel from source code and patches.

.. code:: yaml

   transformer:
   - type: azure_deploy
     requirement:
       azure:
         marketplace: $(marketplace_image)
       core_count: 16
     enabled: true
   - type: kernel_installer
     connection:
       address: $(azure_deploy_address)
       private_key_file: $(admin_private_key_file)
     installer:
       type: source
       location:
         type: repo
         path: /mnt/code
         ref: tags/v4.9.184
       modifier:
         - type: patch
           repo: https://github.com/microsoft/azure-linux-kernel.git
           file_pattern: Patches_Following_Mainline_History/4.9.184/*.patch

Reference

name
~~~~

type: str, optional, default is “not_named”

Part of the test run name. This name will be used to group results and
put it in title of the html report, also the created resources' name
contains this specified str.

.. code:: yaml

   name: Azure Default

test_project
~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: str, optional, default is empty

results in html, it also shows up in notifier message.

.. code:: yaml

   test_project: Azure Image Weekly Testing

test_pass
~~~~~~~~~

type: str, optional, default is empty

The test pass name of this test run. This name combined with test
project name will be used to group test results in html report, it also
shows up in notifier message.

.. code:: yaml

   test_pass: bvt testing

tags
~~~~

type: list of str, optional, default is empty

The tags of the test run. This name combined with test project name and
test pass name will be used to group test results in html report, it
also shows up in notifier message.

.. code:: yaml

   tags:
     - test
     - bvt

concurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~

type: int, optional, default is 1.

The number of concurrent running environments.

exit_on_first_failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool, optional, default is False.

When set to True, LISA will terminate test execution immediately after the first
test case failure. All remaining queued test cases will be marked as skipped
with the message "Test execution stops early." This is particularly useful for
debugging and reproducing specific test failures quickly.

.. code:: yaml

   exit_on_first_failure: true

.. note::
   This setting only affects test case execution order. Test cases that are already
   running in parallel when a failure occurs will continue to completion.

import_builtin_tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool, optional, default is False.

When set to True, LISA will import and make available built-in Microsoft test
cases located in the `lisa/microsoft` directory. These are test cases provided
by Microsoft Linux System Group for comprehensive system validation.

.. code:: yaml

   import_builtin_tests: true

include
~~~~~~~

type: list of path, optional, default is empty

Share runbook parts for similar runs, including the shared content via
that yaml primitive.

path
^^^^

It can be absolute or relative path of current runbook.

extension
~~~~~~~~~

type: list of path str or name/path pairs, optional, default: empty

The path and the name of the modules, we can also just specify the
extension path directly.

.. code:: yaml

   extension:
     - name: ms
       path: ../../extensions

.. _name-1:

name
^^^^

type: str, optional, default is empty

Each extension can be specified a name. With the name, one extension can
reference another one, using above example extension, in code we can
reference it like this way ms.submodule.

.. _path-1:

path
^^^^

type: str, optional, default is empty

Path of extension, it can be absolute or relative path of current
runbook file.

variable
~~~~~~~~

type: list of path str or name/value pairs, optional, default: empty

Used to support variables in other fields.

The values pass from command line has the highest priority, with below
example, any places use ``${subscription_id}`` will be replaced with
value ``subscription id B``.

.. code:: bash

   lisa -r ./microsoft/runbook/azure.yml -v "subscription_id:<subscription id A>"

.. code:: yaml

   variable:
     - name: subscription_id
       value: subscription id B

The variable values in the runbook have higher priority than the same variables
defined in any included runbook file. Thus, ``${location}`` will be replaced with
value ``northeurope`` in the following example.

.. code:: yaml

   include:
     - path: tier.yml
   variable:
     - name: location
       value: northeurope

tier.yml

.. code:: yaml

   variable:
     - name: location
       value: westus3

The later defined variables values in runbook have higher priority than
the same variables previous defined. ``${location}`` will be replaced
with value ``northeurope``.

.. code:: yaml

   variable:
     - name: location
       value: westus3
     - name: location
       value: northeurope

is_case_visible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

type: bool, optional, default is False.

When set to True, the value of this variable will be passed to the testcases,
such as ``perf_nested_kvm_storage_singledisk`` which requires information
about nested image.

is_secret
^^^^^^^^^

type: bool, optional, default is False.

When set to True, the value of this variable will be masked in log and
other output information.

Recommend to use secret file or env variable. It's not recommended to
specify secret value in runbook directly.

.. _name-3:

name
^^^^

type: str, optional, default is the ``type``.

Unique name of the transformer. It's depended by other transformers. If
it's not specified, it will use the ``type`` field. But if there are two
transformers with the same type, one of them should have name at least.

prefix

The depended transformers. The depended transformers will run before
this one.

rename
^^^^^^

type: Dict[str, str], optional, default is None.

The variables, which need to be renamed. If the variable exists already,
its value will be overwritten by the transformer. For example,
``["to_list_image", "image"]`` means change the variable name
``to_list_image`` to ``image``. The original variable name must exist in
the output variables of the transformer.

.. _combinator:

notifier
~~~~~~~~

Receive messages during the test run and output them somewhere.

console
^^^^^^^

One of notifier type. It outputs messages to the console and file log
and demonstrates how to implement notification procedures.

Example of console notifier:

.. code:: yaml

   notifier:
     - type: console

When set to True, subtests will be included as separate test cases in the
JUnit XML output. When set to False, only main test cases are included.

append_message_id
'''''''''''''''''

type: bool, optional, default: True

When set to True, the message ID will be appended to test case names in the
format "test_name (message_id)". This is useful when using combinators to
distinguish multiple test runs of the same test case. When set to False,
only the base test case name is used.

Example of junit notifier:

.. code:: yaml

   notifier:
     - type: junit
       path: ./results.xml
       include_subtest: true
       append_message_id: false

log_agent
^^^^^^^^^

AI-powered log analysis notifier for automated test failure investigation.
This notifier leverages Azure OpenAI to automatically analyze failed test
cases, providing intelligent insights into potential root causes by examining
test execution logs and code context from the LISA framework.

The log_agent notifier uses a multi-agent AI system that combines:

- **LogSearchAgent**: Specialized in searching and analyzing log files for error patterns
- **CodeSearchAgent**: Examines source code files and analyzes implementations related to errors
- **Magentic Orchestration**: Coordinates the agents to provide comprehensive analysis

The analysis results are attached to test result messages and made available to
downstream notifiers and reporting systems.

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Azure OpenAI Access** with the following deployments:
   - GPT-4.1 or GPT-4o for general analysis
   - GPT-4.1 for software-specific analysis (optional)
   - Text-embedding-3-large for similarity calculations (optional)

2. **Required Python packages** (automatically included with LISA):
   - python-dotenv
   - semantic-kernel
   - azure-ai-inference
   - retry

azure_openai_endpoint
'''''''''''''''''''''

type: str, required

Azure OpenAI service endpoint URL for the AI analysis service.

Example: ``https://your-resource.openai.azure.com``

azure_openai_api_key
''''''''''''''''''''

type: str, optional, default: ""

Azure OpenAI API key for authentication. If not set, the notifier will use
default authentication methods available in the environment.

Note: This value is automatically marked as secret and will be masked in logs.

general_deployment_name
'''''''''''''''''''''''

type: str, optional, default: "gpt-4o"

Primary GPT model deployment name for general analysis tasks. This model is used
by the orchestration manager to coordinate the analysis and synthesize findings.

software_deployment_name
''''''''''''''''''''''''

type: str, optional, default: "gpt-4.1"

Specialized GPT model deployment name for software-specific analysis tasks.
This model is used by the CodeSearchAgent for examining source code.

embedding_endpoint
''''''''''''''''''

type: str, optional, default: ""

Optional embedding service endpoint for similarity calculations and analysis
quality measurement.

selected_flow
'''''''''''''

type: str, optional, default: "default"

Analysis workflow type to execute. Currently supported flows:

- **default**: Standard multi-agent analysis workflow
- **gpt-5**: Advanced analysis workflow (future enhancement)

skip_duplicate_errors
'''''''''''''''''''''

type: bool, optional, default: True

When set to True, the notifier will skip analysis for errors that have already
been analyzed in the current test run, improving performance and avoiding
redundant processing.

Example of log_agent notifier:

.. code:: yaml

   notifier:
     - type: log_agent
       azure_openai_endpoint: https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
       azure_openai_api_key: $(azure_openai_api_key)
       general_deployment_name: gpt-4o
       software_deployment_name: gpt-4.1
       selected_flow: default
       skip_duplicate_errors: true

**How it works:**

1. **Failure Detection**: Automatically triggered when test cases fail
2. **Log Analysis**: Searches through test execution logs for error patterns
3. **Code Review**: Examines related source code if call traces are available
4. **Hypothesis Generation**: Generates possible reasons for the failure
5. **Evidence Gathering**: Searches for supporting evidence in logs
6. **Root Cause Analysis**: Provides comprehensive analysis with actionable insights

The AI analysis results are stored in the test result message's ``analysis["AI"]``
field and can be consumed by other notifiers like HTML or custom reporting systems.

environment
~~~~~~~~~~~

List of environments. For more information, refer to
:ref:`write_test/concepts:node and environment`.

set to ``false``, the environment will be skipped during initialization. This is
useful for definining multiple similar environments in the same runbook.

Example:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     environments:
       - name: prod_env
         enabled: true  # This environment will be loaded
         nodes:
           - type: local
       - name: dev_env
         enabled: $(use_dev_env)  # Variable-controlled
         nodes:
           - type: local

type: str, optional, default is “subnet”

The topology of the environment, current only support value “subnet”.

nodes
'''''

List of node, it can be a virtual machine on Azure or Hyper-V, bare metal or
others. For more information, refer to :ref:`write_test/concepts:node and
environment`.

Each node supports an ``enabled`` field:

**enabled** (bool, optional, default is true): Controls whether the node is
loaded during environment initialization. When set to ``false``, the node will
be skipped. This is useful for selecting specific nodes from the same
environment configuration.

Example:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     environments:
       - name: test_env
         nodes:
           - name: node1
             type: local
             enabled: true  # This node will be loaded
           - name: node2
             type: local
             enabled: false  # This node will be skipped
           - name: node3
             type: remote
             address: 192.168.1.100
             enabled: $(enable_node3)  # Variable-controlled

nodes_requirement
'''''''''''''''''

List of testing required environments, by default node_count (default is
1), core_count (default is 1), memory_mb (default is 512 MB), data_disk_count
(default is 0), nic_count (default is 1), gpu_count (default is 0). The
node can be created once the node requirement is met.

.. _type-1:

type


type: str, optional, default value is “requirement”, supported values
are “requirement”, “remote”, “local”.

platform
~~~~~~~~

List of platform, default value is “ready”, current support values are
“ready”, “azure”.

testcase

type: list of str, optional, default: lisa

Criteria to select cases.

criteria
^^^^^^^^

type: list of dictionary, optional, default is empty

Select test cases by area, category, name, priority or tags combined
with select action.

select_action can be “none”, “include”, “exclude”, “forceInclude” and
“forceExclude”, default value is “none”.

.. code:: yaml

   testcase:
     - criteria:
         priority: 0
       select_action: include
     - criteria:
         priority: 1
       select_action: exclude

times
^^^^^

type: int, optional, default is 1

Run this group of test cases the specified number of times. This is useful for
stress testing or ensuring test reliability.

.. code:: yaml

   testcase:
     - criteria:
         priority: 0
       times: 3

.. _retry-1:

retry
^^^^^

type: int, optional, default is 0

Number of retry attempts if a test case fails. When a test case fails, LISA
will automatically retry it up to the specified number of times. The test
environment is deleted and recreated for each retry attempt to ensure a clean
state.

This is particularly useful for:

- Tests that may experience transient failures
- Flaky tests that need multiple attempts to pass
- Tests that interact with external services

.. code:: yaml

   testcase:
     - criteria:
         priority: 0
       retry: 2

.. note::
   The retry count is independent of the times count. If both are set, the test
   will run times × (1 + retry attempts) in the worst case where all attempts fail.

timeout
^^^^^^^

type: int, optional, default is 0

Timeout in seconds for each test case. When a test case runs, LISA uses the
maximum value between the timeout specified in the runbook and the test case's
own metadata timeout. If this field is set to 0 (default) or not specified, only
the test case's metadata timeout is used (which defaults to 3600 seconds / 1 hour
if not explicitly set in the test case). This allows you to extend timeouts for
specific test runs without modifying the test case code.

Note that this timeout applies to the overall test case execution. Any additional
command-level timeouts set within the test case code itself will not be affected
by this setting.

.. code:: yaml

   testcase:
     - criteria:
         name: verify_deployment_provision_ultra_datadisk
       timeout: 3600

use_new_environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

type: bool, optional, default is False

When set to True, each test case with this rule will be run in a newly created
environment. This ensures complete isolation between test cases but increases
the overall test execution time.

.. code:: yaml

   testcase:
     - criteria:
         name: verify_stop_start_in_platform
       use_new_environment: true

ignore_failure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

type: bool, optional, default is False

When set to True, failed test results will be rewritten as success. This is
intended as a temporary workaround for known issues and should not be overused.

.. code:: yaml

   testcase:
     - criteria:
         name: known_flaky_test
       ignore_failure: true

.. warning::
   This setting masks test failures and should only be used as a temporary
   measure. Do not use it to hide real issues.
