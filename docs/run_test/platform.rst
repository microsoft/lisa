Run on Azure
------------

VM can be deployed on Azure using images from vhd, shared image
gallery or marketplace. If multiple types are specified, the first
non-empty type is picked in the following order :
vhd, shared image gallery and marketplace.

Use vhd
^^^^^^^

To run using vhd, add the following to runbook :

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: azure
      ...
      requirement:
         ...
         azure:
            ...
            vhd: "<VHD URL>"
            hyperv_generation: <1 or 2>

The ``<VHD URL>`` can either be a SAS url or a blob url. If it is a SAS url, the image is copied to the resource group: ``lisa_shared_resource``, storage
account: ``lisat{location}{subscription_id[last 8 digits]}`` and container:
``lisa-sas-copied`` in the subscription used to run LISA, which could potentially
increase the runtime. The copied VHD has to be manually deleted by the user.

If the selected VM Size's Hypervisor Generation is '2', hyperv_generation
parameter is necessary, and should be specified as 2.

Use marketplace image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run using marketplace image, add the following to runbook:

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: azure
      ...
      requirement:
         ...
         azure:
            ...
            marketplace: "<Publisher> <Offer> <Sku> <Version>"

Use shared image gallery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run using shared image gallery, add the following to runbook if the shared
image gallery is in the same subscription that is used to run LISA :

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: azure
      ...
      requirement:
         ...
         azure:
            ...
            shared_gallery: "<image_gallery>/<image_definition>/<image_version>"

If the shared image gallery is in a different subscription, ``subscription_id``
needs to be specified. Ensure that the credential used to run LISA has access to
the shared image gallery.

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: azure
      ...
      requirement:
         ...
         azure:
            ...
            shared_gallery: "<subscription_id>/<resource_group>/<image_gallery>/<image_definition>/<image_version>"

The remaining steps are same as outlined in
:doc:`Getting started with Azure <quick_run>`.

Use existing VMs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to deploying a new Azure server and running tests every time, you
can use a deployed resource group or pre-existing resource group. The execution
time is much shorter than deploying a new VM, because it skips deploying VMs,
and avoiding to installing prerequisites packages for some test cases.

If the pre-existing deployment is not created by LISA, the VM names may need to
be specified in the runbook.

1. If there is no deployment to reuse, run with the variables to keep the
   environment after test passed. If there is an existing deployment, skip this
   step.

.. code:: bash

   lisa -r ./microsoft/runbook/azure.yml <other required variables, like subscription id>  -v keep_environment:always

2. Specify the resource group name, and deploy to false to reuse an environment.
   If the environment is deployed by above step, you can find the resource group
   name from the log.

.. code:: bash

   lisa -r ./microsoft/runbook/azure.yml <other required variables, like subscription id> -v deploy:false -v resource_group_name:"<resource group name>"

Set other Azure parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other parameters, like location, vm size, can be specified during
deployment.

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: azure
      ...
      admin_private_key_file: "<path of private key file>"
      azure:
         virtual_network_resource_group: $(vnet_resource_group)
         virtual_network_name: $(vnet_name)
         subnet_prefix: $(subnet_name)
         use_public_address: "<true or false>"
         create_public_address: "<true or false>"
         use_ipv6: "<true or false>"
         enable_vm_nat: "<true or false>"
      requirement:
         ...
         ignored_capability:
            - SerialConsole
            - Isolated_Resource
         azure:
            ...
            location: "<one or multiple locations, split by comma>"
            vm_size: "<vm size>"
            maximize_capability: "<true or false>"
            osdisk_size_in_gb: <disk size in gb>

* **admin_private_key_file**: This step is optional. If not provided, LISA will generate a new key pair for you,
  which can be found in the log folder. LISA connects to the Azure test VM via SSH using key authentication. Before running the test, ensure you have a key pair 
  (both public and private keys). If you already have one, you can skip this step. Otherwise, generate a new key pair using the command below:

  .. code:: bash

     ssh-keygen

.. warning::

   Do not use a passphrase to protect your key, as LISA does not support it.
* **virtual_network_resource_group**. Specify if an existing virtual network
  should be used. If `virtual_network_resource_group` is not provided, a virtual
  network will be created in the default resource group. If
  `virtual_network_resource_group` is provided, an existing virtual network will
  be used.
* **virtual_network_name**. Specify the desired virtual network name.  If 
  `virtual_network_resource_group` is not provided, a virtual network will be
  created and the resulting virtual network name will be
  `<virtual_network_name>`.  If `virtual_network_resource_group` is provided,
  an existing virtual network, with the name equal to `virtual_network_name`,
  will be used.
* **subnet_prefix**. Specify the desired subnet prefix.  If 
  `virtual_network_resource_group` is not provided, a virtual network and
  subnet will be created and the resulting subnets will look like 
  `<subnet_profile>0`, `<subnet_profile>1`, and so on.  If 
  `virtual_network_resource_group` is provided, an existing virtual network and
  subnet, with the name equal to `subnet_prefix`, will be used.
* **use_public_address**. True means to connect to the Azure VMs with their 
  public IP addresses.  False means to connect with the private IP addresses.
  If not provided, the connections will default to using the public IP
  addresses.
* **create_public_address**. True means to create a public IP address for the
  Azure VMs. False means not to create a public IP address.  If not provided,
  the connections will default to create a public IP address. It only can be used when use_public_address is set to false.
  When enable_vm_nat is set to true, the VM can access the internet even without a public IP address.
  If enable_vm_nat is set to false, the VM cannot access the internet without a public IP address.
* **use_ipv6**. When use_ipv6 is set to true, LISA uses IPv6 to connect VMs and 
  the platform may enable IPv6 connections during creating VMs. 
  The default value is `false`, it means IPv4 only.
* **enable_vm_nat**. When enable_vm_nat is set to true, the DefaultOutboundAccess 
  property of the subnet will be set to "True". This allows the VMs in the
  subnet to access the internet. The default value is `false`, it means that
  the DefaultOutboundAccess property of the subnet will be set to "False".
  This means that the VMs in the subnet cannot access the internet.
* **ignored_capability**. Specify feature names which will be ignored in 
  test requirement. You can find the feature name from its name method in source code.
  For example, IsolatedResource feature's name defined in ``lisa/features/isolated_resource.py`` as below:

   .. code:: python

             @classmethod
             def name(cls) -> str:
               return FEATURE_NAME_ISOLATED_RESOURCE

  Then, you can add ``isolated_resource`` to ``ignored_capability``.
* **location**. Specify which locations is used to deploy VMs. It can be one or
  multiple locations. For example, westus3 or westus3,eastus. If multiple
  locations are specified, it means each environment deploys VMs in one of
  location. To test multiple locations together, the :ref:`combinator
  <combinator>` is needed.
* **vm_size**. Specify which vm_size is used to deploy.
* **maximize_capability**. True means to ignore test requirement, and try best to
  run all test cases. Notice, there are some features are conflict by natural,
  so some test cases may not be picked up. This setting is useful to force run
  perf tests on not designed VM sizes.
* **osdisk_size_in_gb** is used to specify the size of the OS disk. If the specified
  size is smaller than the default size, the default size will be used.
  For range of disk size `refer <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/expand-disks?tabs=ubuntu>`__

Run on Ready computers
----------------------

If you have prepared a Linux computer for testing, please run LISA with
``ready`` runbook:

1. Get the IP address of your computer for testing.

2. Get the SSH public/private key pair which can access this computer.

3. Run LISA with parameters below:

   .. code:: bash

      lisa -r ./microsoft/runbook/ready.yml -v public_address:<public address> -v "user_name:<user name>" -v "admin_private_key_file:<private key file>"

The advantage is it's not related to any infra. The shortage is that,
some test cases won't run in Ready platform, for example, test cases
cannot get serial log from a VM directly.

``ready`` runbook also supports tests which require multiple computers (for
example, networking testing); and, it supports password authentication too.
Learn more from :doc:`runbook reference <runbook>`.

For a comprehensive introduction to LISA supported test parameters and runbook
schema, please read :doc:`command-line reference <command_line>` and
:doc:`runbook reference <runbook>`.

Run on Linux and QEMU
---------------------

You can run the tests on Linux machine that has QEMU and KVM installed.

Currently, only the `CBL-Mariner <https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner>`_ distro
is supported. But it should be fairly straightforward to extend support to other
distros. Also, only the the tier 0 tests are currently supported.

For CBL-Mariner:

1. Acquire a VHDX image of CBL-Mariner.

   For example, you can build your own by following the
   `VHDX and VHD images <https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner/blob/main/toolkit/docs/quick_start/quickstart.md#vhdx-and-vhd-images>`_
   build instructions.

2. Convert image from VHDX to qcow2:

   .. code:: bash

      qemu-img convert -f vhdx -O qcow2 "<vhdx file>" "<qcow2 file>"

3. Run LISA with the parameters below:

   .. code:: bash

      ./lisa.sh  -r ./microsoft/runbook/qemu/CBL-Mariner.yml -v "admin_private_key_file:<private key file>" -v "qcow2:<qcow2 file>"

Run on AWS
------------

Linux VM can be deployed on AWS using Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that provides
the information required to launch an instance. At current all AWS resources will
be deployed to the same configured region.

1. Configure the credentials for AWS.
   The credentials could be configured in multiple ways. Please create access keys
   for an AWS Identity and Access Management(IAM) user by following the
   `cli configuration quick start <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html>`_.
   If you have the AWS CLI, then you can run "aws configure" to set up the credentials.

   Or you could add the following configurations to aws runbook:

   .. code:: yaml

      platform:
      - type: aws
         ...
         aws:
            aws_access_key_id: $(aws_access_key_id)
            aws_secret_access_key: $(aws_secret_access_key)
            aws_default_region: $(location)
         requirement:
            ...
            aws:
               ...
               marketplace: "<ami_image_id>"

2. Run LISA with the parameters below:

   .. code:: bash

      ./lisa.sh  -r ./microsoft/runbook/aws.yml -v "admin_username:<username>" -v "admin_private_key_file:<private key file>"

   Update the default user name for the AMI you use to launch the instance.
   For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is ubuntu. Please refer to the
   `general prerequisites for connecting to the instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html>`_.

Run on WSL
------------

WSL is supported cross all platforms by the guest layer in a node. So, it can be
run with Local, Ready, Azure, AWS, BareMetal, etc. It supports below
functionalities:

* Provisioning WSL from a clean environment, or reuse existing WSL environment.
* Replace the default kernel.
* Install distro by names.
* Support kernel format as tar.xz, unzipped kernel, or a folder which contains a
  file starting with "vmlinux-".

The WSL configurations is under platform section as below.

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: ready
      guest_enabled: true # Default is false. Make sure set it to true to enable WSL.
      guests:
      - type: wsl
        reinstall: false # Default is false. Set to true to reinstall WSL every time.
        distro: # distro name in Windows store. Default is Ubuntu.
        kernel: # path to replaced kernel
        debug_console: # true or false. Default is false. Set it to true to pop up console for debugging.

If it needs to copy kernel to the Windows host, you can use the
file_uploader transformer to upload the kernel during the "environment_connected"
phase.

.. code:: yaml

   transformer:
   - type: file_uploader
     phase: environment_connected
     source: D:\temp
     destination: \temp
     files:
       - linux-5.15.123.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2.tar.xz

Run on Hyper-V
---------------

You can run tests on a Hyper-V host on Windows 10/11 desktops or Windows Server. This platform
is useful for development and testing scenarios where you need local VM
management and control. The Hyper-V platform provides full lifecycle management
of test VMs including deployment, configuration, and cleanup.

The Hyper-V platform supports:

* Deploying VMs from VHD and VHDX files
* Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs  
* Secure Boot configuration (disabled by default for compatibility)
* Automatic VHD resizing
* Device passthrough for GPU and other hardware
* Serial console access and logging
* NAT networking for internal switches
* Resource allocation validation
* Compressed file extraction (zip support)
* Multiple Hyper-V host connections

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Windows 10/11 or Windows Server** with Hyper-V role enabled
2. **VHD/VHDX files** for the Linux distributions you want to test
3. **PowerShell execution policy** configured to allow script execution:

   .. code:: powershell

      Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

4. **Sufficient system resources**: LISA automatically validates that the host has enough
   CPU cores and memory for the requested VM configuration
5. **Administrative privileges** on the Hyper-V host (for VM management)
6. **Network connectivity** from test machine to Hyper-V host (if using remote hosts)

Source Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``source`` section configures how VM images are provided:

.. code:: yaml

   hyperv:
     source:
       type: local                    # Currently only 'local' type is supported
       files:
         - source: "/path/to/vm.vhd"  # Path to VHD/VHDX file
           destination: "vm.vhd"      # Optional: custom destination filename
           unzip: true                # Extract if source is a zip file
         - source: "/path/to/vm.zip"  # Compressed VHD files are supported
           unzip: true

Source File Options:

* **source**: Path to the VHD, VHDX, or zip file containing the VM image (required)
* **destination**: Target filename on the Hyper-V host (optional, defaults to source filename)
* **unzip**: Extract zip files automatically (default: false)

Server Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``servers`` section configures Hyper-V host connections:

.. code:: yaml

   hyperv:
     servers:
       - address: "localhost"         # Use local Hyper-V host
         username: ""                 # Empty for Windows authentication
         password: ""
       - address: "hyperv-host.corp"  # Remote Hyper-V host
         username: "domain\\admin"    # Domain or local admin account
         password: "secure_password"

Server Options:

* **address**: Hyper-V host address ("localhost" for local, IP/hostname for remote)
* **username**: Username for authentication (empty string uses current Windows credentials)
* **password**: Password for authentication (empty string uses current Windows credentials)

.. note::
   For localhost connections, you can often omit username/password to use
   current Windows authentication. For remote hosts, you typically need
   administrator credentials.

VM Requirements Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure VM specifications in the ``requirement`` section:

.. code:: yaml

   requirement:
     core_count:
       min: 4              # Minimum CPU cores (required)
       max: 8              # Maximum CPU cores (optional)
     memory_mb:
       min: 4096           # Minimum memory in MB (required)
       max: 8192           # Maximum memory in MB (optional)
     hyperv:
       hyperv_generation: 2          # VM generation (1 or 2)

       device_passthrough:           # Device passthrough config (optional)
         - device_type: "gpu"
           count: 1

Hyper-V Specific Requirements:

* **hyperv_generation**: VM generation (1 or 2, default: 2)
  
  - Generation 1: Compatible with older Linux distributions, uses BIOS
  - Generation 2: Modern Linux distributions, uses UEFI, supports Secure Boot
  
* **osdisk_size_in_gb**: Resize OS disk to specified size in GB (default: 30)

  - If smaller than the source VHD size, no resize is performed
  - Automatically expands the OS partition after resize

Device Passthrough
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LISA supports GPU and other device passthrough to Hyper-V VMs:

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: hyperv
     hyperv:
       device_pools:
         - device_type: "gpu"      # Device type identifier
           devices:
             - instance_id: "PCI\\VEN_10DE&DEV_1234&SUBSYS_12345678&REV_A1\\4&ABCDEF12&0&0008"
               location_path: "PCIROOT(0)#PCI(0300)#PCI(0000)"
               friendly_name: "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080"
   requirement:
     hyperv:
       device_passthrough:
         - device_type: "gpu"
           count: 1             # Number of devices to assign

Device Pool Configuration:

* **device_type**: Identifier for the device type (e.g., "gpu", "fpga")
* **devices**: List of available devices in the pool
* **instance_id**: Windows device instance ID
* **location_path**: PCI location path
* **friendly_name**: Human-readable device name

To find device information on Windows:

.. code:: powershell

   # List GPU devices
   Get-PnpDevice -Class Display | Select-Object InstanceId, FriendlyName
   
   # Get device location path
   Get-PnpDeviceProperty -InstanceId "<instance_id>" -KeyName "DEVPKEY_Device_LocationPaths"

Advanced Configuration Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multi-VM Configuration (currently limited to 1 VM):

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: hyperv
     admin_username: $(vhd_admin_username)
     admin_password: $(vhd_admin_password)
     hyperv:
       source:
         type: local
         files:
           - source: "/path/to/ubuntu.vhd"
       servers:
         - address: "hyperv1.corp"
           username: "domain\\admin"  
           password: "password"
       extra_args:
         - command: "New-VM"
           args: "-MemoryStartupBytes 8GB"
     requirement:
       node_count: 1              # Currently only 1 node supported
       core_count:
         min: 4
       memory_mb:
         min: 4096
       hyperv:
         hyperv_generation: 2
         osdisk_size_in_gb: 100

Custom PowerShell Arguments:

.. code:: yaml

   hyperv:
     extra_args:
       - command: "New-VM"         # PowerShell cmdlet name
         args: "-AutomaticCheckpointsEnabled $false"
       - command: "Set-VM"
         args: "-DynamicMemory $false"

Serial Console and Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LISA automatically configures serial console access for debugging:

* **Serial console logging**: Automatically enabled for all VMs
* **Log location**: Console logs are saved in the test run output directory
* **COM port**: Uses COM1 with named pipe for communication
* **Access**: Serial logs are available during and after test execution

Console logs help troubleshoot boot issues, kernel panics, and VM connectivity problems.

Networking
^^^^^^^^^^

LISA automatically handles network configuration:

* **Switch detection**: Uses the default Hyper-V virtual switch
* **Switch types**:
  
  - **External switches**: Direct VM access via host network
  - **Internal switches**: NAT mapping for VM access (port forwarding)
  
* **IP assignment**: Automatic via Hyper-V DHCP or static configuration
* **SSH access**: Automatic connection setup on port 22 (or mapped port for NAT)

For internal switches, LISA automatically:
1. Detects the switch type
2. Creates NAT port mappings for SSH access
3. Configures the connection to use the mapped port

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local Hyper-V with VHD file:

.. code:: bash

   lisa -r ./microsoft/runbook/hyperv.yml \
     -v "vhd_admin_username:testuser" \
     -v "vhd_admin_password:password123" \
     -v "vhd:/path/to/ubuntu.vhd"

Remote Hyper-V host:

.. code:: bash

   lisa -r ./microsoft/runbook/hyperv.yml \
     -v "vhd_admin_username:testuser" \
     -v "vhd_admin_password:password123" \
     -v "vhd:/path/to/ubuntu.vhd" \
     -v "hv_server_address:hyperv-host.corp" \
     -v "hv_server_username:domain\\admin" \
     -v "hv_server_password:adminpass"

Using compressed VHD files:

.. code:: bash

   lisa -r ./microsoft/runbook/hyperv.yml \
     -v "vhd_admin_username:testuser" \
     -v "vhd_admin_password:password123" \
     -v "vhd:/path/to/ubuntu.vhd.zip"

Testing with specific VM configuration:

.. code:: bash

   lisa -r ./microsoft/runbook/hyperv.yml \
     -v "vhd_admin_username:testuser" \
     -v "vhd_admin_password:password123" \
     -v "vhd:/path/to/ubuntu.vhd" \
     -v "cores:8" \
     -v "memory_mb:8192" \
     -v "osdisk_size_in_gb:100"

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Common Issues and Solutions:

**VM fails to start:**

* Check VHD file path and permissions
* Verify Hyper-V host has sufficient resources
* Review serial console logs for boot errors
* Check VM generation compatibility with the Linux distribution

**Connection timeouts:**

* Verify network switch configuration
* Check if NAT is properly configured for internal switches
* Ensure SSH service is running in the VM
* Review firewall settings on both host and VM

**Device passthrough issues:**

* Verify device is not in use by host or other VMs
* Check device instance IDs and location paths
* Ensure VM is stopped before configuring passthrough
* Review Hyper-V host compatibility for device types

**Resource allocation failures:**

* Check available memory and CPU cores on host
* Review concurrent VM resource usage
* Adjust VM requirements to fit within host limits

**Authentication failures:**

* Verify administrator credentials for Hyper-V host
* Check PowerShell execution policy settings
* Ensure WinRM is configured for remote hosts
* Review domain authentication requirements

For additional troubleshooting, check:

1. **LISA logs**: Contains detailed platform operations and error messages
2. **Serial console logs**: VM boot and kernel messages  
3. **Hyper-V event logs**: Windows Event Viewer → Applications and Services → Microsoft → Windows → Hyper-V
4. **PowerShell transcripts**: If enabled, provide detailed command execution logs
